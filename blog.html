    <h2>Historical Fact</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">In 1386, a pig was executed in France. In the middle Ages, the pig attacked a child who went to die later from their wounds. The pig was arrested, kept in prison and then sent to court where it stood trial for murder, was found guilty and then executed by hanging! 
        During those days, the type of animals put on trial were almost invariably either domesticated ones (most often pigs, but also bulls, horses and cows) or pests such as rats and weevils.</p>
